Just like any bot, Designy has and experiences errors. This page is to help you with some errors you may encounter when using our bot!

## Configuration Based Errors
Most, if not all, errors you may encouter with Designy will result in not configuring the bot.

### Not configuring the channel and/or role error
When you don't set the channel and role you wish to have a command's response used by and sent to, then it will result with the following:``The application did not respond``. If this happens, please try and run `/setting config` and configure all panels and settings. If the error continues, please contact us!
<Warning> We have disabled the Banner Config due to a fatal error, this will hopefully be fixed in the next update. </Warning>
<Note> Things will be added as we find common errors. </Note>
